\>\>Git add "name of file" will allow you to update just one file in the list instead of "Git add ." which is going to push updates for all files

## Creating Vectors

```{r}
rain <- c(3, 5, 10.1, 6)
## Check the class in the console using the class() function

## Let's scale this vector:
rain_scaled <- 5 * rain 
```

## Matrices!

```{r}
## Let's first create a sequence
my_values <- seq(from = 1 , to = 10)

## Let's make this into a matrix. We use the function matrix(). We input the data, how many rows, and how many columns we want in the matrix. Byrow tells us if we want the data to fill in by rows or columns. The default is by columns
my_matrix <- matrix(data = my_values, nrow = 2, ncol = 5, byrow = TRUE)
```

```{r}
## Let's test whether we can create a matrix with data lengths that don't match the dimensions of the matrix we are trying to create
my_matrix_2 <- matrix(data = my_values, nrow = 3, ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE)
my_matrix_2
## What we found is it works with a warning. The data will start repeating...
```

```{r}
## Let's make a matrix with a sequence directly in the matrix instead of creating the sequence first
matrixA <- matrix(data = seq(from = 2, to = 5, length = 10), 
                  nrow = 2 ,
                  ncol = 5, 
                  byrow = TRUE)

## Let's add the matrices
my_matrix + matrixA
```
